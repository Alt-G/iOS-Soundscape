# iOS-Soundscape

Co-Written By:  Thomas Matthias, Lindley Cannon, Gabriel Lamorie, and Aakash Trivedi

This project was created for Spring 2016's DAT 450 - Audio Programming class at Cogswell Polytechnical College.  Our group plan is to create a project that provides a learning platform for both OpenAL/Spatial Audio, as well as Swift iOS Programming.  This project is near completion, and will likely be updated even after submitted as the final project for the course.

The result, iOS-Soundscape, is a relatively simple application that allows the user to move both source sound objects, and a listener object, with UI Icons on a single view iOS application.  The UI Icons represent various sounds and the listener, and control an OpenAL playback object, which handles all of the spatial audio mechanics.
