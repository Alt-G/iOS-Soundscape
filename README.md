# iOS-Soundscape

Co-Written By:  Thomas Matthias, Lindley Cannon, Gabriel Lamorie, and Aakash Trivedi

This project was created for DAT 450 - Audio Programming, at Cogswell Polytechnical College.  Our group plan was to create a project that would provide a learning platform for both OpenAL/Spatial Audio, as well as Swift iOS Programming.  

The result, iOS-Soundscape, is a relatively simple application that allows the user to move both source sound objects, and a listener object, with UI Icons on a single view iOS application.  The UI Icons represent various sounds and the listener, and control an OpenAL playback object, which handles all of the spatial audio mechanics.
